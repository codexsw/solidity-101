# `01` Solidity 101

## Introduction

Welcome to Solidity 101. In this course we will learn how to write our first Solidity smart contracts.

First, lets introduce the learning platform.

This coding environment is Gitpod. Gitpod is an online IDE that allows you to code in your browser. It is based on VS Code and it is free to use. You can learn more about Gitpod [here](https://www.gitpod.io/).

Also we use self-grading exercises. This means that you can test your code by clicking on the "Test" button above. If your code passes all the tests, you will see a green checkmark. If your code fails one or more tests, you will see a red cross. You can click on the "Test" button as many times as you want.

On the left side of the screen you will see a file explorer. You can click on the files to open them. You can also create new files by right-clicking on the file explorer and selecting "New File". You will be creating files on the `contracts` folder.

On the bottom of the screen you will see the terminal. You can use the terminal to run commands.

All exercises include a CLI command to run the tests for that exercise. You can run the tests by clicking on the "Test" button above. You can also run the tests manually by executing the command on the terminal. Which will give you more information about the tests.

Ex:

```shell
npx hardhat test test/12.test.ts
```

## We are all devs here..

Doesn't matter if you are a beginner or an expert, we are all devs here. So, if you have any questions, feel free to reach us online. We are here to help you.

- Copy and paste all the code. Don't type it manually. It will save you a lot of time.

- If you get stuck, don't worry. Just click on the "Test" button. You should also check the tests on each exercise.

- If you found errors in your exercise the best way to track them is to manually run the tests cases on a terminal using this command:

```shell
$ npx hardhat test test/##-test.ts
```

If you found any errors, please report them to [ernesto@codexsw.com](mailto:ernesto@codexsw.com)
