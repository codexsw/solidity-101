# `01` Solidity 101

## Introduction

Welcome to Solidity 101. In this course we will learn how to write our first Solidity smart contract.

First, lets introduce the learning platform.

This coding environment is Gitpod. Gitpod is an online IDE that allows you to code in your browser. It is based on VS Code and it is free to use. You can learn more about Gitpod [here](https://www.gitpod.io/).

Also we use self-grading exercises. This means that you can test your code by clicking on the "Test" button above. If your code passes all the tests, you will see a green checkmark. If your code fails one or more tests, you will see a red cross. You can click on the "Test" button as many times as you want.

## We are all devs here..

Doesn't matter if you are a beginner or an expert, we are all devs here. So, if you have any questions, feel free to ask them in the chat. We are here to help you.

- Copy and paste all the code. Don't type it manually. It will save you a lot of time.

- If you get stuck, don't worry. Just click on the "Test" button. For more advanced students, you can also check the tests on each exercise.

- If you found errors in your exercise the best way to track them is to manually run the tests cases on a terminal using this command:

```shell
$ npx hardhat test test/##-test.ts
```

**Lets go!**
