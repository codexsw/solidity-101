# `20` Congrats

If you have reached this point, you have completed all the exercises in this course. **Congratulations!**

You have learned the basics of Solidity and how to write smart contracts.

There are many more things to learn about Solidity, but you have the basics to start writing your own smart contracts.

## Next Steps

This course has extra modules that you can complete to learn more about Solidity.

- **Hardhat in deep:** Covers how to use Hardhat to compile, test, and deploy smart contracts.
- **Contracts Implementations:** Comprehensive set of smart contracts that you can use in your projects. You will be creating the following contracts:
  - LinkedIn3.0
  - Lending
  - NFTs
  - DigitalLand
  - DAOs
- **Web3.0**: Learn how to interact with smart contracts from a web application.
  - React + Nextjs + wagmi + Metamask
  - Infura
  - Ethers.js

If you kept all your contracts on the contracts folder runnning the following command will compile and test all your contracts.

```bash
npx hardhat test
```
