# `00` Solidity 101

## Introduction

Welcome to Solidity 101. In this course we will learn how to write our first Solidity smart contract.

First, lets introduce the learning platform.

This coding environment is Gitpod. Gitpod is an online IDE that allows you to code in your browser. It is based on VS Code and it is free to use. You can learn more about Gitpod [here](https://www.gitpod.io/).

Also we use self-grading exercises. This means that you can test your code by clicking on the "Test" button above. If your code passes all the tests, you will see a green checkmark. If your code fails one or more tests, you will see a red cross. You can click on the "Test" button as many times as you want.

<table style="width: 100%; background-color: red; color: white; ">
    <tr>
        <td>Foo</td>
    </tr>
</table>
